## Data Cleaning

Data often needs to be cleaned. This ensures the best dataset to use for analysis.

```{r}
## put the csv here
source("00_requirements.R")

hateCrime <- read_csv("hate_crime.csv")
```

## Cleaning the Data

First, we will remove any rows with missing values. Then, we will convert categorical variables to factors.
This is done using functions defined in "01_funct_DataCleaning.R".
What this does is that it sources the functions from that file and applies them to the `hateCrime` dataset.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

source("01_funct_DataCleaning.R")
hateCrime_Clean <- remove_na(hateCrime)

hateCrime_Final <- to_factors(hateCrime_Clean)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
