## Data Cleaning

Data often needs to be cleaned. This ensures the best dataset to use for analysis.

```{r}
## put the csv here
source("00_requirements.R")

hateCrime <- read_csv("hate_crime.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
