# for all ploting code and testing
As mentioned in the data cleaning file, we will be exploring the following prompts and basing the plots off of this.


1. count the number of offenses per bias to see which group is most targeted

Using a bar graph we can see that 
```{r}
#plot_bar(hateCrime_Final, x = Bias, fill = Bias)
```


2. count the number of offenses per race to see which group is more likely to be the offender

```{r}

```

3. how has the number of offenses changed over the years 

```{r}

```

4. variation by state of types of offenses

```{r}

```

5. how many of each type of offense there is and compare

```{r}

```

6. how biases and offense correlate (eg. do asians experience intimidation based hate crimes or assult based hate crimes)
