# STAT107_Project_Group_9_Hate_Crime_Statistics
A project for the course STATS107. This will take data from the FBI, analyze it, and answer several questions

### The point of this project is to take the data about hate crimes, provided by the FBI, clean the data, and compile it into something that could be used and understood.

This project uses functions, and different libraries to run the code, and make it easier on the eyes to view the code when the functions are packed away in different files, all nice and neat.

To start out, run the files, **00_requirements.R**, **01_funct_DataCeaning.R**, and **02_funct_Plots.R**. That way, all of the functions and libraries needed for this project are downloaded and ready for use.
